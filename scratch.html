		<h2>Scratch Content</h2>
		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<p>Description: used scratch to use our name in motion with cool designs and animations.
		The requirements were to have every sprite move, and have three different movements. 
		It needed to start once the green flag was clicked. 
		For extra credit I made it so that all of my sprites returned to their starting positions.
</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: Concepts Learned: 
Using event blocks- green flag, space key.
Used loops- to keep or stop movement of sprites (forever, repeat until)
Movement- rotation and moving steps for the letters, gliding for the baseball.</h2>
		
		<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<p>Description: Use a presentation to choose a computer that best fits the buyer</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned: Broadcasting, Chat/dialogue between sprites, Switching between backdrops, Entering in outside information into scratch
		
		<h1>Final Project</h1>
		<p>Description: Create a game or story using scratch.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:Motion of sprites at same time of programming, Changing backdrops after an event happens
		VariablesCreating own sprite</h2>
